# mysql-world-cities-states-countries

A complete SQL dump of **countries, states, and cities** for **MySQL**, with all relationships handled via foreign keys.

This set includes three files:

1. `countries.sql` – Master list of countries  
2. `states.sql` – States/regions linked to countries  
3. `cities.sql` – Cities linked to states (and indirectly to countries)

All tables are designed for MySQL and preserve proper relational integrity.

Enjoy 🙂
